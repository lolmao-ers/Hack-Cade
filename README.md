During this tough time, staying at home has become monotonous and boring with sources of entertainment dwindling daily.  So, we at TeamOP decided to make a cool throwback to 90s Retro Games with diverse and fun-to-play levels. 

## What it does

Your computer is infected with the dangerous virus Covid-20!
Startup your anti-virus and jump into 3 fun and nostalgic levels in order to restore your backup and kill all the viruses!
- Level-1: Dodge from the viruses and collect the bits of recovery data.

- Level-2: Trample and destroy the evil viruses and recover your backup file.

- Level-3: Defeat all the remaining viruses in an epic space battle!

## How we built it

**GB Studio**: We used GB Studio as a GUI platform for building our game from the ground up.

**Tiled**: We used Tiled's easy-to-use features in order to make our maps from scratch using various community tilesets.

**Piskel**: We used Piskel's interactive editor to make sprites and make our maps prettier.

**PhotoShop**: We used photoshop to fine-tune some of our sprites and making sure that they met the correct dimensions and colors as per GameBoy requirements.

## Challenges we ran into

We had faced a big challenge incorporating Pacman into a GameBoy Preset since it is not available as a GameBoy Game.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of what we achieved during these 3 days while making a game with custom sprites, maps, and AI. We managed to make a game with 3 different and fun levels with a throwback to many classic retro games.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about the amount of time and effort it goes into game development and making new things like maps and sprites and how to change their colors and dimensions in order to make them fit properly in-game.

## What's next for Anti-Virus
- Improving enemy AI in PacMan level and Space Invaders Level.
- A new RPG-style level as a throwback to classic Pokemon games.
- Adding new and cool ammos in Space Invader.
